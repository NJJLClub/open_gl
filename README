o.  To find out which version you have
    available on your linux machine; you can look
    at the gl.h file and look at GL_VERSION_*
    macros to see which version it is.

    > grep GL_VERSION /usr/include/GL/gl.h

    #define GL_VERSION_1_1   1
    #define GL_VERSION_1_2   1
    #define GL_VERSION_1_3   1
    #define GL_VERSION                              0x1F02
    
    
o   OpenGL 2.0 contains GLSL (the OpenGL Shading Language)
    Added support for a true, GPU-based assembly language
    called ARB (designed by the Architecture Review Board).

o   OpenGL 3.0 released July 2008 added support for frame
    buffer objects, hardware instancing, vertex array objects, and
    sRGB framebuffers.
    

o   OpenGL 4.2 released August 8th 2011
    Support for shaders with atomic counters

    Capturing GPU-tesselllated geometry and drawing multiple instances
    of the result of a transform feedback to enable complex
    objects to be efficiently repositioned and replicated.

    Support for packing multiple 8 and 16 bit values into a single
    32-bit value for efficient shader processing with significantly
    reduced memory storage and bandwidth.
